#Run Chain_Test.py to create and test chain configuration

#For imports to work correctly, ensure Chain_Test.py and dnsChain.py are in same folder location

#block_creation.py is base code for creating block as a reference.  This file is not needed to run a test and the code is duplicated in 
#dnsChain.py
